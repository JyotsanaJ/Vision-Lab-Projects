## Projects Overview
-----------------

1.  **GANs for Image Generation**
    *   This project demonstrates the use of GANs for generating realistic images. GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, which compete against each other to produce high-quality images.
    *   Topics include:
        *   Training a GAN on various datasets (e.g., CelebA, CIFAR-10)
        *   Generating synthetic images using trained GAN models
        *   Evaluating the quality of generated images using perceptual metrics
2.  **Object Detection with CLIP**
    *   This project showcases how to perform object detection using CLIP, a transformer-based model capable of understanding both images and text. CLIP is trained on large-scale image-text pairs and can be fine-tuned for various downstream tasks.
    *   Topics include:
        *   Fine-tuning CLIP for object detection tasks
        *   Training on custom datasets
        *   Evaluating object detection performance using standard metrics
